/// Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g. event: message_stop), and include the matching event type in its data.
///
/// Each stream uses the following event flow:
///
/// message_start: contains a Message object with empty content.
/// A series of content blocks, each of which have a content_block_start, one or more content_block_delta events, and a content_block_stop event. Each content block will have an index that corresponds to its index in the final Message content array.
/// One or more message_delta events, indicating top-level changes to the final Message object.
/// A final message_stop event.
///
/// This structured sequence facilitates the orderly reception and processing of message components and overall changes.
